# Filtering

You're task is to add task filtering to Taskly, purely in JavaScript. Go in
order, don't try to do everything all at once! Here's the steps:

1. Provide a filter that filters out tasks based on name.
1. If a task list has all tasks filtered out, that task list is hidden
1. If I clear out the filter input manually, everything is shown
1. I can click "Clear" to clear out my filter and everything is shown
1. The filter matches sub-strings on a task. So a task named "This is my awesome
   task" would be matched by a filter named "awesome".
